# Changelog v2

This document records the significant changes and fixes made during our debugging session.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Tokenizer Overhaul:** Replaced the fundamentally flawed `BPETokenizer` with a new, robust implementation to solve the core text generation issue.
  - The new tokenizer correctly processes spaces and punctuation by using an end-of-word token (`</w>`) and a proper regex pre-tokenizer, inspired by the standard GPT-2 approach.
  - This resolves the critical bug that caused generated text to be a single, garbled word (e.g., `Thesecrettohappinessis...`).
  - The `encode` and `decode` methods now correctly map between text and token IDs, preserving whitespace and sentence structure.
- **Colab Dependency Conflicts:** Resolved persistent `pip` installation errors in the Google Colab notebook.
  - The notebook now installs a minimal, specific set of packages (`datasets`, `fsspec`, `huggingface-hub`, `PyYAML`) with known compatible versions. This prevents conflicts with the default Colab environment that were causing the data-loading process to fail.

### Changed
- **Colab Notebook Workflow:** Significantly improved the `Run_in_Colab.ipynb` workflow for a more reliable and user-friendly experience. The notebook generation script (`generate_notebook.py`) was updated to produce this new flow.
  - The notebook now automatically pulls the latest code from GitHub if the repository already exists, ensuring fixes are always applied without needing to re-clone.
  - A new "Clean Up Old Files" step was added to programmatically delete stale model checkpoints and tokenizers from Google Drive. This prevents using broken artifacts from previous failed training runs.

### Added
- **`CHANGELOG_v2.md`:** This file, to provide a detailed, human-readable record of our debugging and fixing session.
